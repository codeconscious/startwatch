# Startwatch

This is a very simple wrapper around the `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch` class that just shows "friendly" versions of elapsed times via its `GetElapsedTime` property.

Since it starts tracking time at class instantiation, its name is "Startwatch." ^_^

I largely created this to get some experience uploading packages to Nuget.org, but I also use it in some of my personal projects.
