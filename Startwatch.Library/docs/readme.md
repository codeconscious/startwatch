# Startwatch

This is a very simple wrapper around `System.Diagnostics.Stopwatch`. Since its stopwatch starts automatically, its name is "Startwatch." ^_^

I largely created this to get some experience uploading a package to Nuget.org, but also to use in some of my personal projects.

Note that the API of this library could change significantly at any moment.
